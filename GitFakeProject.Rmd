You are starting a new project and want to connect it to GitHub
New project in a new directory
```{r}
#connect it to github
usethis::use_git()
#you then have to go to the console and write 1
```

load oxygen data
```{r}
# Step 1: Read the file into a character vector
file_path <- "FakeProjectData/SITES_ADD-PROF_ASA_FER_20170817-20171115_L2_30min.csv"
lines <- readLines(file_path)

# Step 2: Find the line containing the delimiter
delimiter <- "####"
delimiter_line <- grep(delimiter, lines)

# Check if the delimiter was found
if (length(delimiter_line) == 0) {
  stop("Delimiter not found in the file.")
}

# Step 3: Read the file again, skipping lines before the delimiter
# Adjust the starting line to skip the delimiter line itself
start_line <- delimiter_line
data <- read.csv(file_path, skip = start_line)

# Print the loaded data
print(data)

```
